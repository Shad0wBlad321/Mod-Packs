    <description>It took around 2 hours (and a colonist that could read) to page through a one page long fireproof, blast-proof and squirrel proof survival guide, that was found in pod debris. It was short and very helpful.

    <description>It was pretty simple math for him, for each square arm he could fit 1.7 square legs. 
Raiders were always so helpful as a measurement tools, especially when they were dead.
Thanks to that his new designs could withstand 20 units of squirrel force per second, for entire 2.6 seconds, thats 0.3 more than any existing design!
Yes, that was a stroke of genius.
