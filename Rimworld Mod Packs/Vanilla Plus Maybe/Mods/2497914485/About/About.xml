	<description>Version 1.21
This mod adds the ability to auto-replow the soil under harvested crops with a toggle in the growing zone.

The mod depends on Vanilla Plants Expanded, as it uses their soil plowing mechanism. Special thanks to the Vanilla Expanded team, Sarg, Oskar and Chowder, for building such a great mod collection!
It also utilizes harmony and has to be loaded after both.

Example Load Order:
	Harmony
	Core
	...
	Vanilla Plants Expanded
	[Vanilla Plants Expanded - Succulents or sth.]
	Vanilla Plants Expanded - Auto Plow Patch
	...

The mod can securely be added to and removed from an existing savegame.

To establish backward compatibility with lower versions of this mod there is a compatibility patcher included. After loaded a save once, this can be disabled in the mod settings. You can create a save without compatibility settings.

Incompatibilities:
	DocWorld and Fertile Fields [1.1] (both loaded. Only one of them is fine.)
