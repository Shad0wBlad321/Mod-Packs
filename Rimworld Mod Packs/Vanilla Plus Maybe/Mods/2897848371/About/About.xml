  <description>This mod reduces the size of wind turbines to 4x2, allowing them to line up with solar panels.  It also reduces the area that needs to be kept clear to 4x4 behind and 8x4 in front, which  is the exact space needed for three solar panels.
  
UPDATE: turbine blades have been shortened to fit within the four-tile width.



Can this be added to an existing save?

Yes, your existing turbines will shrink.

Can this be removed from an existing save?

Yes, but either deconstruct your wind turbines first or leave enough room for them to grow back to their original size.
