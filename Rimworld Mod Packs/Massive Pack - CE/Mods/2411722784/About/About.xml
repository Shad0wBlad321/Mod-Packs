<description>What is Rimdeed®?
Rimdeed is an online comms console service that allows businesses to seek new recruits. Our online CVs offer just enough information about the jobseeker so our clients can hire a new beloved member of their team!

How do jobseekers work?

* So what does this mod do?
- Rimdeed® is a service that can be found in the comms console to hire new pawns to work for your colony. They will stay there permanently once you accept their application. You can also Trade In your colonists or prisoners that you would rather send to Rimdeed to be treated humanely instead of the dangerous and highly unethical slaver industry. Rimdeed® provides a protection period for newly hired jobseekers and will ban businesses who endanger the lives of our applicants from using our service.

* Is Rimdeed compatible with "Set-up Camp"?
- Rimdeed® will run with the mod with no errors or other intrusive issues, however ordering applications may not work with being inside a camp that was set up using the mod, due to those "maps" having problems with incidents that trigger on their map.

There they will be given their own accomodations, treated to five star dining and given high quality medical treatment as they await a new place of employment.

* Will Trade In with Rimdeed cause "sold to slavery" negative moodlet?
- Employees sent to the Corporate Hubworld will be taken care of and provided high quality facilities for the benefit of sending them to future employment, that they are consenting to and are given incentive to apply for.

Rimdeed® believes in delivering quality of care to every employee who we highly value due to the profits they generate.
