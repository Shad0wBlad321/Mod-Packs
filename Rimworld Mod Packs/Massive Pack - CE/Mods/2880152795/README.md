# Warhammer 40k - Genes and Psycasts for rimworld

## Suggestions
https://forms.gle/5YpXFs7UgMokhvYa7

## Future Things?
1. Make a standalone psycast mod - WILL DO
2. Event? (big baddie coming to hurt you)
3. Persona traits?
4. Astropaths & navigators?
5. Black carapace works and overwrites warcasket trait from VFE pirates - allowing work.
6. Genestealer?

## To do (Not ordered)
1. Acquire daemon, primarch & custodes genes through ????
2. Faction; title system from royalty.
3. Make Daemon mutation make the carrier immortal by essentially respawning them.
4. Make custom code to remove/prevent hediffs from getting applied, anything not warp caused.
5. Make progenoid glands give an additional harvest of gene-seeds when a pawn dies.
6. Make it use weapons and armor from other mods if they are present.
7. Make config for progenoid glands - make people able to adjust days to grow and materials required. 
8. Make daemon sprites
9. Give Khorne marked pawns special abilities that grows stronger the more they've killed
10. Make nurgles rot transform pawn into plaugebearer upon death
11. add mass and body size (the attribute that gives more meat & leather) to genes with body size (visual)
12. Remembrance ability should destroy the corpse and possibly only work on fresh ones.
13. Redo thingss affecting bleeding and pain as marines can be downed and get up again and rejoin without too many concequences - mostly pain might need fixing.
14. Toggable patch to make progenoid gland take entire germline instead space marine only.
15. Primarch can be harvested for space marine genes too?

## Fixes to do
1. Psytrainer quest reward giving access to paths without psyker gene.
2. Head and armor issues with size increase (HAR specific??)
3. diseaseProgressionFactor might stop some diseases from healing

## Genes
First 19 gene-seed have a complexity of 2, all 3 primaris have a complexity of 4 and requires 1 archite capsule.
