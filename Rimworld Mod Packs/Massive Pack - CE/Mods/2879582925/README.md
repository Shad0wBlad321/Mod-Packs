# Death Rattle

This mod has a rich history. It started [here](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=34469.0) on the Ludeon Forums in 2018. It was created and maintained by [Linq](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1552452572) until 1.0, then updated by [deathrat](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2013400235) (1.1), [Troopersmith1](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2206107940) (1.2, 1.3), and finally me (1.4, steam link pending).

A different mod which has similar functionality (patches a different method) is [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1464742390).

If you're looking for a vanilla way to do this, you can go into storyteller settings. When you pick/change the difficulty, pick Custom. There's an option there for both enemy downed death % chance as well as colonist death on down %.

Feel free to use the GitHub repo and contact me regarding push requests, issues, feature requests or whatever you like.
