            Vanilla Backgrounds Expanded is a mod that adds many new main menu and loading screen backgrounds inspired by RimWorld - all created by Oskar Potocki for the purpose of Vanilla Expanded mod series. With mod options, you will be fully able to customize what backgrounds appear in the game, whether they cycle or not, and how long should it take for them to change into other backgrounds.
            
               Modders can easily add new BackgroundDefs which will be automatically picked up by our mod options menu. 
                  
                     The background images within this mod are protected under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0. They cannot be reuploaded, modified or exploited without permission. You can, however, use them as your PC wallpaper if you want. If you're a youtuber, you can use them in your videos and youtube thumbnail images.

            I'm sure you're tired of looking for mods that add new tracks, only for them to hardly fit among the vanilla ones. Even if they are great songs of their own right, you just can't play with that dissonance. I feel the same way, this is my attempt at rectifying that. I love Alistair's style, he did a wonderful job with the OST and it's a shame so many music mods diverge from his iconic sound so much.
            
               NOTE: For some reason the Music Manager bugs out when you skim to different points of a track added by this mod. Dunno why that's the case but keep that in mind if you're using it (it isn't required).

            This mod reduces the size of wind turbines to 4x2, allowing them to line up with solar panels.  It also reduces the area that needs to be kept clear to 4x4 behind and 8x4 in front, which  is the exact space needed for three solar panels.
              
               UPDATE: turbine blades have been shortened to fit within the four-tile width.
                  
                     
                        
                           Can this be added to an existing save?
                              
                                 Yes, your existing turbines will shrink.
                                    
                                       Can this be removed from an existing save?
                                          
                                             Yes, but either deconstruct your wind turbines first or leave enough room for them to grow back to their original size.

            Vanilla Expanded Framework incorporates a multitude of functionalities for different mods in order for us to boost performance by not duplicating code across several mods. Examples of shared functionality include custom base generation code with an amazing building export tool, customisable sieges, faction-based pack animal textures, faction based apparel colouring system, Orion’s Faction Discovery revamped and improved, Item processor code, shields, and many, many others.
            	
               	Orion's Faction Discovery?
                  
                     Yes!We have negotiated a deal with Orion and included his Faction Discovery mod within Vanilla Expanded Framework. Now, if you decide to add a faction to an existing playthrough, upon loading up the save you will have an option to spawn it's settlements and define how many of them you would like to spawn, as well as how far away from the player.

            Vanilla power generation is somewhat lackluster late game - Not only the game strongly encourages the use of solar panels and wind turbines as they provide significantly more energy at the cost of no fuel, but it also stops there - there is no technological progression in regards to power. Whether you’re an early industrial colony, or a spacer super-empire (and we all like to roleplay different ways), you’re bound to use the same power sources.
            
               Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Power module adds a plethora of new power sources, ranging all the way from small portable generators and large scale industrial ones, all the way to advanced spacer-tech green energy sources and a unique, and yet easy to understand nuclear generator. A selection of new batteries will help you with storing the power, whist the new utilities like a lightning rod and chemfuel pump will give you brand new ways of obtaining power and fuel.
                  
                     A new, vanilla-fitting energy chain has been added in the form of helixien gas - a combustible substance found mostly on the planets on the galaxy rim. It can be used to power a vast array of new gas-operated structures, making them completely immune from solar flares! Helixien gas can be stored in gas tanks for later use, uses a gas pipe system for connecting to structures and can easily be turned into electricity using gas-operated generators!

            Vanilla Chemfuel Expanded is a small mod created to showcase what the new Pipe network code is capable of in Vanilla Expanded framework. It adds a simple chain to extract Deepchem from the underground pockets and refine it into Chemfuel. It also adds storage solutions for both Deepchem and standard chemfuel, alongside a few structures including a Refinery and Chemfuel tap. Player can now connect any refuelable chemfuel-powered structures to the pipe network to make sure everything refuels automatically.
            	
               This mod is not trying to be better than other available chemfuel-related mods. Instead, it exists to showcase what our framework is capable of doing, and to provide an example for other modders what they can do if they choose to use Vanilla Expanded Framework. As a by-product, it's a vanilla-friendly mod that adds an infinite source of chemfuel provided that the player constructs the required infrastructure.

            Vanilla Achievements Expanded is a unique, never before seen in RimWorld modding achievement mod, part of the Vanilla Expanded mod series and a framework for other modders. 
            This mod adds an extensive achievement system, with various different stats being tracked. Players receive a pop up rewarding them for going above and beyond and pushing their boundaries. Players receive achievement points which can not only be shown off, but also can be used to fire several types of pre-existing in-game events.
               
                  Most achievement trackers (described below) can be used in xml. This means other modders can include an Achievements.xml file in their mods and inject custom, mod specific achievements into our framework. That is of course if Vanilla Achievements Expanded is active.

            Vanilla Cooking Expanded is a core module in a brand new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team, notably Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder. Whilst other mods work very well without it, Vanilla Cooking Expanded makes use of fish from Vanilla Fishing Expanded as well as plants from Vanilla Plants Expanded in order to provide users with a more in-depth cooking experience.
            
               Mechanics are simple and intuitive - keeping within the vanilla spirit without the unnecessary fluff and production chains. Your colonists will be able to cook up a variety of new meal types, make mood boosting desserts out of fruits, make filling grilled meals that lose the effect when frozen, create large bakes using flour or produce large quantities of soup through boiling ingredients for several days at a time. Using our new system, you can now transform animal milk into cheese inside a cheese press - and it gains quality, and with that - value, the longer it’s inside! Yes, alongside Vanilla Factions Expanded - Medieval you can now create a cheese and wine empire! Hopefully this will provide one more reason to keep livestock!
                  
                     Our systems are heavily moddable and support a variety of pre-existing mods. With Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids you can now transform insectoid milk into insectoid cheese, and thanks to Sarg Bjornson, you can now utilise 19 (!) types of milk from Alpha Animals, Vanilla Genetics Expanded and Alpha Bees to create your cheese empire!
                        
                           New ways of preserving food in the form of canning and deep frying, as well as a brand new condiment system will allow you to create not-so-filling gourmet meals that apply 12h long effects to people who consume them.

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Production module, is an ideal mod to fill that late game hole in production. Once you set up your vanilla workstations with tool cabinets scattered everywhere, you essentially got as far as you possibly can. This carefully designed, vanilla-fitting mod adds a new layer to workstation layout, hopefully allowing players to create manufacturing-designated rooms instead of one massive room with all the workbenches.
            
               Linkables:
                  - Kitchen Sink Cabinet
                     - Tailor Cabinet

            Vanilla Helixien Gas Expanded is a brand new mod for the release of RimWorld 1.4. With this update, we've decided that it's best we split Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Power and the Helixien gas, as not only it gives us more control over it, but it's also the only logical choice, as the helixien gas is very complex and occupies a big portion of VFE-Power.
              
                 When you update your Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Power to 1.4, you will no longer have Helixien gas in it. If you'd still like it: you need to download this mod as well. Previous Helixien gas system was coded by Fluffy, but because he is no longer around as often, we decided to move the system to the one written by Kikohi which we already used in Vanilla Chemfuel Expanded.
                    
                       With this mod you will be able to drill for Helixien gas and install a pump that gives you access to cheap, combustible and nearly infinite fuel supply. You can construct numerous appliances that rely on gas and are solar flare immune. From gas stoves and smithys to lamps and heaters, you can now bring the gas power to your colony.

            Vanilla Psycasts Expanded is potentially our Magnum Opus, a greatest, most exquisite, complex and visually stunning mod up to date. As always, it started with us simply not being satisfied with how Psycasts ended up being in Royalty DLC. This resulted in us wanting to expand on the concept, and expand we did.
            	
               Inspired by games such as World of Warcraft, Stellaris, Path of Exile and many more, we have designed a brand new system that makes Psycasters truly worth-while, whilst also keeping everything anchored in the grim universe of RimWorld. This mod does not add fantasy character classes, tossing fireballs left and right, conjuring holy magic to repel demons etc. It simply expands on the mysterious psychic powers granted by the link to an archotech.
                  
                     Complex level-up system will reward you for meditating, allowing you to distribute ability points in many different paths, unlocking hundreds of new, unique abilities, each kept in line with vanilla psycasts when it comes to balancing and visuals. Ultimately, it’s up to you if you want to become a fire-slinging conflagrator, an animal ruling wildspeaker, or a mix of both. As it always is with RPG games, you can also spend level-up points on upgrading your overall psycaster stats.
                        
                           On rare occasions, enemies can send their finest psycasters against you. They will be able to use all their unlocked abilities to defeat you, so you should make sure to prioritize them. Don’t worry - Psycaster raids are rare, and the game prompts you with fair warnings that an enemy raid is utilising a psycaster.
                              
                                 If you like going balls to the wall, however, Basilicus Bestower is a new storyteller that allows any pawn to appear as a psycaster. This means you will see psycasters in almost every raid.
                                    
                                       This mod should be compatible with most of the mods, except the mods that add new psycasts or change existing ones. Please check the mod description on Steam Workshop for details into what mods are not compatible.

            Modifies quest rewards to focus heavily on items that cannot be crafted. This mod adds no new items.  Quests should consistently reward exotic items and neurotrainers, though this won't significantly alter the cash value of the rewards.  Rewards from the Imperial faction will be of higher quality.
             
                This is a manual retooling of loot tables, so will omit items from mods unless they are specifically added.  This requires little work but must be done for each item.  Feedback is appreciated.

            After a long delay, our brand new Vanilla Factions Expanded module is now ready. Insectoids feature a diversified, new, unplayable faction that will populate the world with insects and monstrosities your colonists never dreamt of. Led by an Ancient Insectoid queen, these eusocial creatures can be heard chittering underground, with outposts and villages across the surface mysteriously disappearing overnight.
            
               Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids allows you to take a fight to the insects. No longer such an interesting faction will be limited to one ingame event only. Insectoids now possess bases on the surface - in the form of overrun outposts filled with riches and hives for you to purge.
                  
                     They will now be allowed to raid, the same way as mechanoids or other factions can. They won’t engage in diplomacy and they won’t give you quests - as they are forever hostile. This mod features a number of new insectoids filling various niches whilst still keeping the feel of the faction the same as in vanilla - melee only, relying on swarming their opponents.
                        
                           For those brave enough to harness their power, bio-engineering is now a thing. Obtained from traders and quest rewards only, players can now vat-grow over 20 unique insectoids, obeying their every command and performing tasks around the base.
                              
                                 Genomes used in bio-engineering can also be implanted in colonists and prisoners alike, leading to various genetic mutations - some good, some bad.
                                    
                                       New riot gear is craftable and ready to be used by your base security whilst new quest-reward only plasma weapons will allow you to get rid of the insectoids even more effectively.
                                          
                                             Mercenaries starting scenario pits you in the battle against the insectoids at the very beginning, placing you on the outskirts of an overrun outpost. Can you clear it out with your superior weaponry and call it home? Or will you evacuate the area and find a new settlement?

            Mod version: v1.1.4.
            
               Adds refrigerated racks to keep food and other perishables cold.  Ideal for use in dining rooms, freeing up labour from feeding prisoners, or keeping food on hand for cooks.
                  
                     RimFridges that are placed next to Nutrient Paste Dispenser will act as hoppers.
                        
                           Base RimFridge comes in 1x1, 1x2, and 2x2 versions.  A "Wall" version of the 1x1 and 1x2 can be used to divide rooms and separate the kitchen from the dining area, or create hard, impassible aisles of freezers.  Wall RimFridges are accessible by pawns from both sides.
                              
                                 Each cell of a RimFridge can store three stacks of items, much like shelves in version 1.4 of RimWorld.
                                    
                                       Beer and some other alcohols such as RimCusine 2's Stout, Ale, Grog and Cider gain a "Frosty" moodlet if chilled in a RimFridge and drunk by a colonist, because who doesn't like a cold one after a long day's work?  Additional items from other mods can be easily added to the XML files in Defs\ThingDefs_Buildings.
                                          
                                             A note to modders, this mod no longer destroys Rottables with its own version and all destructive prefixes were removed.  All code was moved to a ThingComp which can be attached onto any Building_Storage that has power to give it Refrigeration capabilities.

            Deep Storage Units: yet another storage solution
            
               LWM presents a way to organize your supplies, loot, clothes, and even your garbage, to allow you a tidy base where your colonists aren't simply dumping stuff on the floor.  Deep Storage units include medicine cabinets, meat hooks, clothing racks, weapon lockers, etc, and all can store diverse items - just like regular shelves, but they allow more than one thing!
                  
                     ADDON MODS:
                         * Note: I have not used these, and have been super busy so haven't had a chance to add anything to the base mod. If you find right-clicking on storage slow, you might try this:

                               * Little Storage 2, Vault, Simple Storage, etc - if you want more ways to store things, there are several available in the Steam workshop!
                                 
                                    FAQ / "I have a problem":
                                        * Meat Hooks require the Smithing research!
                                           * These Hampers are made of fabric, they don't hold fabric
                                              * Does it work with Vanilla shelves?

            One of the first mods I ever came up with, and one that took the longest to design, draw, code and deliver, Vanilla Factions Expanded - Mechanoids is a mod unlike any other. A group of talented modders came together to make sure this mod is not only full of new interesting content, but also provides something to make the game a bit more dynamic.
            
               We have improved on the Custom Settlement Generation code to provide you with semi-random spaceships that Mechanoids can use to wreak havoc on the planet’s surface. Thanks to a lot of cooperation from some of the most famous modders out there, we were able to provide you with not just a new faction, but a unique mechanic of Total War, which makes the faction stronger the more ships land on the planet. We were also able to give you a little Factorio love letter in the form of fully automated machines that produce various items in the game, automatically. Did I mention it’s all happening automatically?
                  
                     New buildable mechanoids can fill various roles around your colony, from cleaning and hauling to base defense. With supercomputers, you can now automate research, Autosowers and Autoharvesters on the other hand will allow you to begin your farming enterprise with no need for physical labor.
                        
                           New quests, new events, new starting scenario, a storyteller, it’s all waiting for you. Merry Christmas!

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.
            
               Weapons are spread across the technology tree allowing for realistic and time-consuming progression, making the higher-tech weapons even more rewarding. Bear in mind, however, that all weapons are perfectly balanced in line with Vanilla weapons, which means that a Battle Rifle added by this mod might not necessarily be better than a standard assault rifle in some situations.

            The first iteration of this mod, Medieval faction, is a missing link between tribals and outlanders. With this mod you can experience the proper medieval siege, as the enemy base generation builds a massive, towering fortress with buildings inside. Have your own vineyard and brew the best wine, which gains in value the longer it’s in the barrel! Medieval subjects will be equipped with new armor, color-coded depending on the faction color, making medieval armies look like an actual army serving the same lord. Receive caravans of medieval armor makers, weaponsmiths, mercenaries and the elusive art patron!

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Laser is an addition to one of the most popular mods of Vanilla Expanded collection - Vanilla Weapons Expanded, however it can be played without it. This mod adds a selection of ultratech weapons, with a small number of them craftable, whilst keeping the majority of them only obtainable from the enemy drops, world quests and traders. Laser weapons introduce a new projectile type - a laser beam that has a slight chance of setting the enemy on fire. These weapons have high armour piercing and are extremely effective in combat against armored enemies and mechanoids.
            
               Salvaged Laser weapons are obtainable by players using a new Salvage laser weapon recipe, which uses intellectual skill of pawns and allows them to look through advanced components to come up with a random laser weapon. Salvaged laser weapons are less accurate than their state-of-the-art ultratech counterparts, and are more prone to overheating.
                  
                     Laser weapons have a brand new warm-up mechanic making them perfect for defensive battles - the longer your pawn is stationary whilst firing, the faster the weapon can fire. Once it reaches maximum firing speed however, it can overheat, causing a small explosion with a chance of setting your pawn on fire.

            One faction that always felt a little bit 'un-expanded' in vanilla RimWorld is the pirate faction. They feel more like evil outlanders than anything unique, and they don't really threaten late game colonies, nor do they provide engaging content in any way, shape or form. It always annoyed me that they are industrial tier only and don't even spawn with charge rifles anymore.
              
                 Roolo, Smash Phil and I are launching a new pirate survival video game inspired by RimWorld on Kickstarter. It's called Cursed Crew if anyone would like to check it out. I figured that the best way to promote the game through the channels I know a lot about is to create a mod, ideally a factions expanded mod, expanding pirates. Of course there is no boats and sea-faring pirates in RimWorld, but there are space pirates, so let's expand them!
                    
                       Vanilla Factions Expanded - Pirates greatly expands the vanilla pirate faction by adding new events, technology, defense means etc. We are also adding two new factions - Junkers, which are inspired by the hordes of Huns, but instead of riding horses, they weld themselves inside powerful warcaskets; and Mercenaries, a spacer-tech faction of 'legal', sanctioned pirates that you can befriend!
                          
                             You can now use your Comms console to hire pirates too! Pirates you hire join you for a period of time, but they come with a hefty price.
                                
                                   And most importantly, you can now create warcaskets - steel suits of industrial-tier armor, a powered-armor precursor, around your pawns. Fully customizable, with unique weapons and armor graphics!
                                      
                                         And with Ideology, you can enjoy a new Pirate meme, with singing sea shanties and much more important camaraderie!
                                            
                                               Do check out Cursed Crew, as if you liked RimWorld, I'm sure you will like our take on rogue-like survival, sailing the endless ocean and fighting dangerous, mythical creatures.

            Vanilla Fishing Expanded is a first module in a brand new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team. With such an important mechanic missing from the base game, we Oskar and Sarg have decided to introduce a way to catch fish in your local water sources, adding a bit of purpose for settling near running water and ocean side.
            
               With simple, intuitive, vanilla-like mechanics, all it takes is to designate a fishing zone same way you designate a growing zone, and assign your Animals capable pawns to the new fishing job type. In no time they will pull out fishing rods from their invisible bags, head straight down to the river and whilst chatting to each other, try to catch a new meat type called fish, which can be eaten raw (providing an Ate raw food debuff, just like regular vanilla meat), or used in a cooking recipe. Unlike other mods, the fish don’t need to be butchered.

            Vanilla Textures Expanded is a full-scale overhaul of vanilla (unmodded) RimWorld textures, with its main aim being not only to fix less aesthetically pleasing textures, but also to bring vanilla aesthetic in-line with that of Vanilla Expanded mod series.
            
               This texture pack includes over 450 textures remade in vector-based software (same method used for Vanilla Expanded mods), exported into 2x the size of vanilla textures. What used to be blurred before, now will be sharp and crisp, even if zoomed in fully using mods by the likes of Camera+.
                  
                     When redrawing vanilla textures, our main focus was on keeping them consistent with what players are used to - don’t expect any drastic design changes - we have only changed the look of things that were really bad or ambiguous.
                        
                           We plan to keep adding new textures in the future, so make sure to let us know what particular textures in vanilla game require changes!

            With a brand new utility item code introduced in RimWorld 1.2 update, I saw it as a perfect fit to make grenades be actually useful instead of forcing you to choose between a grenade and a rifle. By crafting grenade belts, you can now equip all vanilla and vanilla expanded grenade types on your pawn alongside any weapon you wish, and use them manually by selecting a special “throw grenade” button on the menu, next to the draft button.
            
               You heard it right, now you can launch grenades and continue to fire your assault carbine at your enemies! No need to call out that single useless colonist that always carries just grenades.
                  
                     What’s the drawback? Grenades on the belt are limited, much like the ammo for the Grenadier suit in Royalty DLC, you now need to refill the grenades after the charges deplete. You refill them using the grenade type they are made out of - Frag grenade belt gets refilled with frag grenades etc.
                        
                           Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days. This mod has built in support for other Vanilla Expanded grenades - VWE smoke, flash and gas grenades as well as dynamite from VFE - Settlers!

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Non-Lethal has been a commonly requested weapon set. So many times prison breaks result in accidental deaths. So many times, an enemy raider is your colonist’s father and you accidentally put a sniper rifle round through his skull. So many times your berserk pawn starts to fight with your melee expert with archotech arms, resulting in, well, death.
            
               Thanks to this mod, you will now have numerous ways of dispatching crowds and taking down single targets - you can use tear gas to blind groups of opponents, tasers to stun single targets, and dart guns to bring down even the hardest foes in a matter of seconds.

            Allows you to use Biotech's growth vats to grow clones asexually from only one donor parent regardless of fertility or age, copying their entire xenotype.
            Also includes an optional mutations system where clones have a random chance to gain genes on birth. Settings allows you to customize overall mutation chance as well as which genes are eligible for mutation and how likely each gene is. Defaults are mostly negative mutations.
               Update 0.2 includes a new system for cloning xenogenes from the donor pawn, and even allows you to design the clone's genes directly using the Biotech gene bank system. Read the update news for more info.
                  
                     
                        Under development, everything seems to work but there are likely to still be bugs and oversights. Please report bugs on the steam page.

                                       - Should be compatible with Questionable Ethics Enhanced, even though they do the same thing in different ways.

On top of that, it adds a lot of new weather types, many with custom visual effects to spice up your game.

            This mod allows other mods to get what type of stone would be at a place if it were exposed stone terrain. Without modifying how stone types are distributed around the map, this isn't possible, believe it or not. Strangely, by default, it uses a random seed each time. This means that after the map is generated there's no way to know what that seed was and thus no way to find out what stone would go where.
              
                 You don't need this unless a mod you want to use is dependent on it, but if you think you might use one of those mods in the future then you could use this by itself. It will change the stone generation on its own but this won't have any obvious impact on your game without a mod that depends on that change.
                    
                       For modders, to get the stone type at a particular cell, add the assembly reference to this mod and then do something like the following:
                          var st = Map.GetComponent&lt;CMS.MapComponent_StoneGrid&gt;().StoneTypeAt(c);
                             
                                Be sure to add it as a dependency for your mod in the Steam upload so it's easy for users to find and install this dependency!

            This mod changes the way the deep drill selects what stone to yield - instead of being entirely random based on what types are on the map, it uses the Consistent Map Stone mod to determine it based on where you placed the drill.
            
               Need more marble? Place it on some marble. Need granite? Place it on some granite. In vanilla, it's as if all of the bedrock types are interwoven in some nonsense way, with Consistent Deep Drill Stone it is as it should be.
                  
                     Requires my Consistent Map Stone mod.

            This mod makes it so that people will no longer instantly die when their vital capacities reach zero. If one of your colonists has their liver destroyed by a charge lance, for instance, they will become severely ill and you will have a short window to get them a new liver before they die.
            
               The time scales in this mod are not entirely realistic, because Rimworld's time scale makes it effectively impossible for a colonist to receive life-saving care in a realistic amount of time. Colonists move too slowly, and days pass too quickly, so the numbers have been fudged to make it difficult, but possible, to save someone if you have a donor organ on hand.
                  
                     Be warned: Just because they survive, doesn't mean they won't suffer permanent brain injury as a result of their near-death experience.
                        
                           Now incorporates the functionality of Death Rattle Comatose into the main mod. Also adjusted the severity of acute liver failure and the threshold before brain damage begins to occur, which allows more time to react to the injury.
                              
                                 It should be compatible with everything. Just try it, and let me know if it doesn't work, so I can fix it.
                                    
                                       Includes a patch for EPOE: Forked so that the Neuro-Cure can be used to repair Brain Damage.

            This mod will patch the Ideology Biosculpter Pod's Regen cycle to replace internal organs you need to live. 
            By default losing these organs is immediately fatal but with death rattle you may have a short amount of time to get a pawn into a pod to regrow these missing organs.
                 
                  This mod can technically be run without Death Rattle, to allow missing lungs or kidneys to be regrown.

                  Dried meat has less shelf life than pemmican, but dried meat is available without research and plant products are unnecessary.

                                          Вяленое мясо,хранится меньше чем пеммикан, но высушенное мясо доступно без иследования и ненужны продукты растительного происхождения.
                                             Охлажденные сохранятся еще дольше.

            A very simple patch that sets the wealth of all constructed floors to 1. The way floors impact colony wealth in vanilla always made little sense to me, especially since all pre-placed floors on the starting map automatically counted towards your wealth. Now those raiders won't send an army after you just because you dared to lay some good-looking parquet!

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Architect has been on my mind for a very long time. I always download every single mod adding new floors or fences, but I quickly become buried under all the new options, and eventually get pissed off because some of those options don't exactly fit Vanilla game in my eyes.
            	
               	I want new carpet colors, but I don't want all RGB hues - I want a small, tailored selection that fits the game. I want new tiles and floors, but I don't want 100 different patterns that have no distinction between them other than the looks. I want new fences, but I don't want more fence types than there are floor types. I want less, but I want more significant!
                  	
                     	Thus, Architect Expanded was born. Not only does it add new walls, fences, floors and carpets in various, vanilla-fitting colors, it also adds stone and metal bridges, as well as foundations that you can place on sand, so building in the desert will no longer be a problem! I seem to have forgotten to mention that wood now comes in 4 colors, all using just the base wood resource - so you can decide upon building what color your wooden objects will be!
                        	
                           	I really hope you will enjoy everything this mod has to offer, and it will allow you to make your colony at least twice as beautiful to look at.

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security module is a result of hours upon hours of hard work. It has been a long time since we began working on this mod, and with a team of brilliant programmers, I am not honored to present to you a Vanilla Expanded approach to base defenses. Every word and every stat in this mod have been carefully prepared to be as balanced and as “vanilla” as possible. 
            
               This module introduces 27 new defense structures, all neatly filling up the Security tab in the Architect menu. With research technologies spread out across all stages of the game, this mod itself is enough to provide you with hours of entertainment.

            This mod expands upon the mysterious lore of the rich and utopian Glitterworlds, adding a set of new deadly laser weapons which cause a new unique hediff and that can only be bought or discovered through quests and rewards.
            	             These weapons are stronger than your average charge weapon, making them extremely effective as endgame weapons.
               		
                  	             This mod depends on the Athena Framework for some of its features.

                                      -  Integration in the starting pawns, as well as slaves and refugees
                                         -  Gender distribution
                                            -  Backstories
                                               -  Drawsize (independent from race size)
                                                  -  Support for genderless races
                                                     -  Optional immunity to aging related body problems

            Allows you to recruit visitors. At a price, of course. 
            
               You can also improve your relationship with visiting factions and sell items to visiting guests. Guests will buy and use things inside of their allowed area.
                  
                     
                        Errors and bugs: If you get errors, most likely Hospitality is clashing with another mod you're using.
                           
                              So to help me fix bugs, please describe clearly what happened. I also need a log. You create it by pressing Ctrl-F12 after you get an error or the problem first occurs. You'll get a link that you can post with your description. 
                                 
                                    Hospitality should be loaded as late as possible in the load order.

            I have always found vanilla furniture to be lacking in depth and quantity. After researching Complex Furniture, the research tree for furniture pretty much ends, with a couple of odd technologies adding things like Vitals Monitors and Hospital Beds along the way. As part of the Vanilla Furniture Expanded mod, the team consisting of the Author of Android Tiers, Atlas, and me would like to add some sort of progression to the furniture of the rim, whilst also keeping it Vanilla friendly.

            Mechanoids don't have regular meatbag eyes, so why shouldn't they be able to see in the dark? And plus: work mechs don't sleep; so clearly they should be designed to work at any time of day. This mod removes the global work speed penalty from low light for mechanoids.

                      * Place down a Duel Spot (under the Misc tab) to have your colonists engage in friendly duels.
                         * Craft Lassos at a tailor bench and equip them to pawns for an edge against gunfighters.

Instead of having strict negative or positive effects, purple events force players to adapt as they last significantly longer than events like Toxic Fallout or Volcanic Winter.

            Standalone version of the buildings from my Gene Variety mod.
            
               Adds the Gene Archive and Register, advanced gene banks that can hold up to 24 and 80 genes instead of 4, respectively, though at a higher cost in material, power, and space.
                  
                     Adds a Gene Macroprocesser and Gene Subprocesser, advanced gene processors that improve genetic complexity by 8 and 4 respectively instead of 2, though at a higher cost in material, power, while the subprocesser makes for far more efficient use of space.
                        
                           Added compatibility between Biotech Cloning Mod's Clone Extractor building and the attachable buildings of this mod. It's a great mod, go check them out.

            Vanilla Animals Expanded is a large mod that contains almost all previous Vanilla Animals Expanded modules, this time merged into one big mod. Fear not, however - last thing we want is to bloat your game: you can now disable individual animals in mod options! You can only enable the animals that appear in your biome if you want.
            
               The reason we merged all the animal mods is because they are finished - the only new animals we have planned fit into standalone packs. We have already covered all the biomes, so it’s only proper we clean it up and make it into one big mod.
                  
                     No, we have no plans to merge any other mods together.
                        
                           This mod adds dozens of new animals that fit RimWorld aesthethic, from house cats and rottweilers to anacondas and indian elephants, it really breathes a lot of life into the game and makes every biome feel very, very unique.

            Caves is one of the biomes we have never covered or even considered covering before, but here we are! With this mod, you can tame powerful cave bears, collect colorful blind salamanders, run away from insectoid hulks, bond with incredibly agile and dangerous wyrms, get poisoned by cave crawlers or discover giant spider nests!
            
               This mod supports the Arachnophobia setting which removes legs from the spiders, making them look much more friendly!
                  
                     This mod has been commissioned by Aquiles and created and balanced by Vanilla Expanded team.
                        
                           Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Endangered biome expansion. It adds 11 new animals that will spawn as part of a new event. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.

            Remember how I said the Temperate animals mod was the last one? Well, people lie. There is still a few animals around the world that we did not yet make into actual RimWorld animals - and this time we have decided to also raise awareness of the big issue in our world - endangered species and animal conservation.
            
               From pandas and pangolins to already extinct tasmanian tigers and quaggas, you can now help with animal conservation in RimWorld. These animals, just like in our world, are endangered, and don’t appear naturally on the map. Instead, they can arrive in a rare ‘Endangered animals wander in’ event, giving you a chance to tame them and breed them. Releasing them to repopulate their species - which is a new option added by this mod - allows you to gain relations with other factions too!

            Royal animals is something we have promised a long time ago, and never quite found the time to deliver. From the very initial notions, what we wanted to do is to introduce some special animals with unique gimmicks that could go alongside the pampered nobles in the Royalty DLC.
            
               This is a great opportunity for us to create something super unique and not entirely realistic - whilst also making the Royalty DLC more attractive by utilising mechanics and code added in it. I hope this selection of animals will make you want to collect them all, as each of them comes with a unique function that’s bound to come in handy.

            This module adds 11 new extinct animals to Rimworld, brought back to life with the wonders of genetic engineering. It is quite that simple actually. All of them fit perfectly into vanilla Rimworld and will spawn in their respective biomes, but are rarer than normal vanilla animals.

            Persistent Precepts adds a simple toggle to the Ideology edit screen that prevents the re-randomization of Ideology precepts, rituals, buildings etc. when you change structure or memes.
            	
               	With this mod, you can ensure that your carefully crafted Ideology remains intact, even if you go back and change structure/memes. This also means your saved ideoligions can better act as templates when you load them in.
                  
                     	When the toggle is on, ideology re-randomization for the player is blocked for:
                        	* Precepts
                           	* Roles
                              	* Rituals
                                 	* Buildings
                                    	* Relics
                                       	* Weapons
                                          	* Venerated Animals
                                             	* Preferred Xenotypes
                                                	* Preferred Apparel
                                                   	* Appearance (Hair, Beards, Tattoos)
                                                      
                                                         
                                                            	Please note: The confirmation warning of re-randomizing precepts still comes up, please ignore it for now while I work out how to change the confirmation dialogue.
                                                               	If you start a new game and forget to turn the toggle off, your faction's ideology will be generated without any precepts/rituals etc. This is easily fixed by flicking the toggle back off and selecting "Randomize Precepts" button. Other factions generated at world creation and as part of events are not impacted.
                                                                  
                                                                     	Compatibility
                                                                        	The mod uses harmony to patch a few methods related to player actions on the ideology edit screen and precept randomization. It touches nothing else besides adding the checkbox so should be highly compatible with other mods.

                                 Packaged survival meal and pemmicans as well as preserved food added by mods are no longer prioritized.
                                    If you use this mod, you don't have to change the food restrictions of the caravan participating members every time you send out the caravan.

                           You can choose an interval from once a quadrum to hourly. Rendered images will be saved in a chosen directory. For example you can use them to create an animated gif or video of your current run.
                              
                                 Place special corner marker designators to limit the area of what should be rendered. You can limit this to your base and even just simply extend it later if you base grows larger than planned.

                 - Technology Blueprints &amp; Reverse Engineering (t3 miner bill option)
                  
                       This is our remake of Project RimFactory, its a overhauled version of great old mod by spdskatr.
                          We have expanded on original ideas and tried adding some more story to it.
                           
                                Also try balance and stay in line with vanilla and other mods on workshop, without going too OP.
                                   Or too far.
                                      (we have sub mods for that.... :p)
                                       
                                            We hope you enjoy this mod, if you need more info checkout our steam page, github page or join our discord.

            Consider inventing the humble mini-turret.
            
               In vanilla Rimworld, the process is:
                      A colonist sits in front of a research table and stares at it for five weeks. 
                     
                        
                           With Research Reinvented, the process can include any of the following:
                                  Reverse engineer existing commandeered turrets.
                                     See what you can learn from that ancient broken down security turret.
                                        Analyse raw materials for their durability as turret armor.
                                           Experiment with steel to figure out efficient barrel replacements.
                                              Test out what modifications to the standard machine pistol or autopistol design might make for the best turret weapon.
                                                 Construct a prototype turret, even if it takes longer and the end product might need some fixing up right away.
                                                
                                                   
                                                      Taking advantage of such research opportunities can significantly accelerate your research progress. However, if none are available, the fallback Theory research is equivalent in speed to vanilla research (this speed can be lowered in the mod settings, if you'd prefer an incentive to seek opportunities out).

            A fork of "ResearchPal - Forked". Double-forked, you might say? This started out as a simple 1.4 update but has evolved into a number of changes, such as optimizations, minor bug fixes and tweaks.

Similarly, some roads require a certain percentage of the workforce to have a certain construction skill. If only a lower percentage is available, work will be reduced. If no colonist in the caravan has the required skill, work will be impossible. Prisoners don't work.

Roads cost more at higher elevation, starting from 1000m. Hills and swamps also have an effect, which can be checked when clicking on a site. When ISR2G is not used, the total cost can be further reduced from 100% down to 10% in the settings. Anything lower than 100% is probably quite unrealistic, but feel free to use the option.

            Your colonists can never be a true Rambo if they cannot gun while they are running. Therefore, this mod adds a mode that, when enabled, allows drafted colonists to shoot 
            while moving at the cost of an accuracy and movement penalty.These penalties can be modified in the mod settings of this mod. 
               Some things to take into account: 
                  - Fire at will should be enabled. Firing manually will cause the pawn to stop running. 
                     - RunAndGun mode can only be enabled when the pawn is drafted, and is carrying a ranged weapon in its hands. 
                        - The movement penalty is only applied at the moment the pawn is actually shooting or cooling down after shooting. So don't bother disabling RunAndGun every time you just want your pawn to walk somewhere.

                                    This mod depends on Hugslib, so make sure that mod loads before this mod does.

                                                This mod should be compatible with existing saves, and removing the mod from saves shouldn't introduce problems. Moreover, this mod should be compatible with most other mods (including Combat Extended). However, keep in mind that this is hard to test for me by myself, and this is the first release.
                                                   Therefore some issues regarding mod compatibility are bound to come up. Most issues that come up should be easy to fix, so please report any problems.

            These are flying caravans, meant to load people and cargo and bring it somewhere else -- potentially a very long distance, and back again. These act like drop pods, but are not one use -- when you bring it back home you choose where to land and disembark.
            
               Great for hauling cargo, trading with factions, assaulting points of interest on your world map, and so much more. Acts as both a caravan and a drop pod.
                  
                     A few additional role-specific short range transport shuttles (or SRTS) so you really can fly across the whole world and back again. All ships require their own research project, and they're not cheap. All passengers heal, rest, and eat while on board all transport shuttles, but some shuttles are easier than others to rest in.

                              - Multiplayer mod: You will not be able to actually load anything into the ship. It won't work. Sorry.

            This mod adds 3 traits, a different reaction to the bite dependant on the relationship between the pawns, and an auto-feed option.
            
               The traits:
                  - Sanguophile: loves to be fed on, bonus opinion on sanguophages.
                     - Sanguofriend: doesn't mind being fed on, gets a tiny mood bonus for helping their friend out.
                        - Sanguophobe: hates sanguophages, will have an opinion debuff on them.
                           
                              When pawns have an opinion of 85 or more towards the sanguophage, or they're in any kind of (vanilla) love relationship, they'll have a positive reaction to the bite.
                                 
                                    There are settings for almost every value, including a toggle per-pawn for auto-feed. Auto-feed will only happen with pawns that won't get upset about it.
                                        
                                          Felt weird that everyone absolutely hated being bitten regardless of their relationship with the sanguophage, it bothered me so much that I learnt how to mod just to make this.
                                             	
                                                Let me know if you find any issues with it and I'll try my best to fix it if it's within my ability.

               Pawns show their hands on their weapon when drafted. 
                  Should work with most weapons, vanilla and modded.
                     
                        Based on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2171708109]Clutter Weapon Hands[/url] but dynamically sets the hands based on the graphics of the weapon. It will however still use the old hand-definitions if they exist.
                           
                              There is also mod-settings where you can modify the settings for each weapon. These settings can be exported and included in a mod to add native support.
                                 All my "Continued"-mods should have native support.

            AUTOMATIC's Original Trader ships mod, updated to 1.4 by BlackFox.
            
               Adds trader spaceships to the game. Ships will visit your colony, preferring landing pads, and trade with you just like visiting caravans. Trader ships are meant to replace orbital traders, but you can set both to be active in settings.
                  
                     1.4 update 1: Added several new options to customize the trader ships events.

            Vanilla Brewing Expanded is an alcohol-oriented module in “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team, notably Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder. Whilst other mods such as Vanilla Plants Expanded and Vanilla Fishing Expanded work well as standalone, due to technical limitations Vanilla Brewing Expanded requires the Core cooking mod.
            
               We made sure to keep the mechanics of this mod simple and intuitive without ruining the spirit of vanilla gameplay. All elements of this mod offer unique advantages and disadvantages, enhancing the depth of the game a thousandfold. With 7 unique, new alcohol types, you can now tailor your colonists’ drinking habits to your liking, with each alcohol having a unique production chain, buffs, downsides and uses.
                  
                     We strive to add unique elements for every single one of our players. A widely requested feature - tea and coffee, has also been added, allowing you to brew an immunity boosting hot tea, or whip out hot and iced coffees that help with staying awake and provide help against hypothermia and heat stroke respectively. Cigarettes and cigars also make an appearance, very addictive but incredibly helpful in stressful situations.

               Vanilla Brewing Expanded - Coffee and Tea is another sub-module to the new Vanilla Cuisine Expanded mod series. This particular mod introduces 8 new types of coffee and 9 new types of tea, with ties in to other Vanilla Cuisine Expanded mods, with each coffee and tea granting unique effects!
                  
                     From regular lattes and pumpkin spiced coffee, to kombucha and cannibal coffee, this mod has something for everyone, and will surely help your pawns warm up in the cold winter evenings!
                        
                           With Vanilla Plants Expanded you will gain access to Lemons, and Vanilla Cooking Expanded will allow you to farm mint - a new condiment boosting social impact!

            After 6 months in development and almost 2 months in beta testing, we are absolutely ecstatic to show you the effect of our hard work - Vanilla Factions Expanded - Vikings. This mod will enhance your selection of pre-industrial factions by adding two new Viking tribes - both with new, custom-made, legit name generators! It’s up to you to decide whether you want to help them pillage, or get pillaged by them!
            
               This mod utilises a vast amount of new custom code we made available in Vanilla Expanded framework, including custom base generation code, which makes all sieges much more authentic! A number of new weapons, armor, apparel and furniture is also added, greatly adding to your selection of medieval flavour. To those who prefer spacer vibes, rare, experimental cryptotech weapons and armor are also added - now you can literally freeze your enemies as you shoot them!
                  
                     Various new quests and events allow you to add more dynamic to any playthrough, as they will work just as well for a viking clan as they will for industrial or spacer colony. Hunt legendary creatures, explore ancient dangers, ransack viking tombs or get raided by two new raid types - pillagers, who will come and go like a thunder, stealing your valuables and throwing torches at your base, and slavers, led by a number of wolfhounds, they will try to kidnap all your colonists!
                        
                           Freya Fierce storyteller introduces a new raid restlessness mechanic, forcing your colony to venture into the world and complete missions in order to remove a stacking debuff for inactivity! Event-wise, she’s just like Randy, but allows you to have 2x as many pawns due to the need for annual caravans.
                              
                                 This mod is the effect of hard work of a large number of us. I really hope you will appreciate it. Check out our new Youtube channel for a full content breakdown.

            This started out as a fork and merging of the Better Vents and Better Coolers mod, utilizing the Vanilla Expanded Framework instead, along with more compatible definition patching methods. It has evolved to include new features such as a wall heater, wall lights, and fencepost lamps.
            		
               		Credit goes to Skullywag for the original vent and cooler graphics.

               Let the river wash your trash away!
                  
                     This mod lets things float in water and move with the stream. In non-streaming water things will move about at random. Things can leave the map this way so can be used to dispose of things you dont want, corpses for example.
                        
                           There is a possibility that things spawn in the river that you can get use of, or even downed pawns you can choose to rescue. If [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761421485]Allow Tool[/url] is active you can set all spawning items to be hauled urgently automatically. 
                              
                                 There is also bars and nets that can be built in water. The bars can catch large objects like corpses, living pawns, weapons and apparel while the metal net can catch all items.
                                    
                                       Pawns may also loose their footing in moving water. They can also drown if being downed in water. Certain apparel will prevent this, such as the power-armor helmet. Any headgear with the EVA-tag from SOS2 will be considered a breathable helmet.
                                          
                                             If [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1542399915]SwimmingKit[/url] is loaded, pawns with higher swimspeed will float slower when downed. Also pawns with the Nimble trait will be half as likely to loose their footing.
                                                
                                                   Technically the mod looks at all items in water-tiles and calculates their floating value. This is based on what stuff is used to build the item, but some things like corpses have a default float value. Its also possible to add floatable-values to other things via patches, there is a patch for barrels of fecal-matter from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836308268]Dubs Bad Hygiene[/url] that can be used as an example. Higher floatable values makes things move quicker in the water.
                                                      
                                                         I made it mostly for my own playthrough but hopefully someone else can get joy from it!

            Vanilla Apparel Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Weapons Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.
            
               Apparel is distributed into several new technologies that need to be researched, expanding the life of the game and possibly leading to some interesting choices - research a way to get off this planet? Or maybe learn how to craft jeans and workwear?
                  
                     This mod adds a wide selection of apparel with useful effects, including but not limited to:
                        Gas masks protecting from toxicity;
                           Jumpsuits and aprons for work speed boost;

               Armor is spread across several new technologies that need to be researched which in turn adds valuable game time before you achieve everything there is to achieve. New items cover all technological eras, from wooden armours of neolithic tribes, through chainmails and chestplates of medieval kingdoms, bulletproof vests and ghillie suits of the modern era combat all the way to two, brand new variants of a regular marine armor - one of them with an integrated ranged shield belt!

            Vanilla Backstories Expanded was a mod suggested by my patrons right after we released Vanilla Backgrounds Expanded and everyone thought that was the mod adding backstories. It wasn’t. This one is.
            
               This mod features over 150 backstories, carefully selected from the submissions from our Patrons and testers, as well as quite a large number of backstories written by us, VE team members. I have ran a little experiment and asked various people from our community channels to write their own backstory that reflects what they do in real life, but placed in RimWorld universe. Some submissions have been absolutely stellar, and that inspired us to put them in the game.
                  
                     We have paid extreme attention to making sure that they all fit the game perfectly. They should be very well balanced as well - we made several balance passes and ran a VE-team vote on the most fitting backstories.
                        
                           If you find any typos or issues, please be sure to let us know, telling us which specific backstory you have found a problem with!

            Vanilla Base Generation Expanded is a mod many have been waiting for. Probably one of the most disappoint aspects of venturing out in a caravan in RimWorld is the fact that no matter where you go and no matter what base you raid, after you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. Vanilla Bases tend to often resemble so called ‘20 granite door borg cube bases’.
            
               Kikohi set out on a mission to fix that, and with the help from our testing community, we have created a huge library of assets that the base will pull out of, procedurally generating unique villages, towns and megabases every time you visit a new location.
                  
                     The look of the bases and the assets use vary from faction to faction - tribal villages will have swathes of farmland around them, whilst pirate bases will be essentially bunkers with mortars and automatic defenses.

            Vanilla Cooking Expanded - Stews is a first sub-module to the new Vanilla Cuisine Expanded mod series. This particular mod introduces medieval stews - which are more nutritious, more expensive soups that are cooked over time on the wood-fired pot.
            
               Ideal for your medieval colonies and long winter nights, these stews remove any debuffs from eating ingredients like insect meat and human meat! Time to sneak some human flesh into your diet.

            Vanilla Cooking Expanded - Sushi is the second sub-module to the new Vanilla Cuisine Expanded mod series. This particular mod introduces sushi - a fish and rice based food that is immensely popular on the Rim.
            
               The module is an amazing way to make good use of our fishing mod, since all sushi meals need fish. It also includes two new plants, wasabi and soybeans, and two new condiments extracted from them: wasabi paste and soy sauce. Soy sauce needs to be fermented, and its quality will increase with time, in case you decide to use it as a "cash crop".
                  
                     And of course you can always deep fry your sushi.

            Vanilla Expanded Royalty patches is a large collection of patches for all of our Vanilla Expanded mods, bringing key functionality to complement Royalty DLC mechanics. This patch collection will be constantly updated as time goes on with new Vanilla Expanded mods.
            
               You do not need all the Vanilla Expanded mods for this to work - the patches trigger only if their respective mods are found.
                      
                     This mod requires Royalty to work, obviously.

            One faction we have never really tinkered with before is the Ancients. You might know them from popping out of the cryptosleep caskets in Ancient dangers, but what really is their story remains a mystery. With Ideology DLC, players can see the entire ancient battlefields of twisted metal, broken down warwalkers and shells of ancient mechanoids. What really happened is also, as you’re probably aware, a mystery. Well look no further.
            
               Vanilla Factions Expanded: Ancients allows you to discover hidden vaults that don’t announce their presence, staying perfectly hidden until you intercept one of the ancient burst signals they send between each other. You can now break open the huge, armored doors and see the technology of the ancients first hand. You should, however, do so carefully. Whilst there are many Looted vaults scattered around the world, with barely any danger in them, some of those vaults are still mysteriously sealed, with nothing but hum of machinery coming out of them when you get close. 
                  
                     Uncover the ancient technology used long ago in a war almost no one remembers anymore. Collect remnants of the ancient tech to assemble a workshop made to inject your pawns with a mysterious strain of super nanites, granting them powers of super-humans with a risk of severe brain damage. Explore new ancient locations, including freshly unlocked ancient vaults, potentially guarded by super-soldiers who believe the war is still ongoing, awaiting every day for new commands from HQ that no longer exist.
                        
                           This mod will expand on the ancient ruins in vanilla games, adding new ancient structures, clutter, debris and much, much more. Alternatively, start a new scenario as these very supersoldiers guarding an ancient vault. Decide if you want to wake your fellow soldiers up despite the food shortage, or let them sleep in the cryptosleep caskets until the colony is prepared to take them in.

            One thing I always wanted to do but never could bring myself to do is overhaul the Empire faction in the Royalty DLC. For such a mysterious, powerful entity in the political sphere of RimWorld, there is surprisingly little content around them. When I wanted to make a Royalty focused playthrough, I quickly realized it’s just a ‘normal playthrough’ with ‘royalty sprinkles’ - so not really what I wanted.
            
               So I did what I do best and sat down with my trusty google docs to design a complete overhaul to the Empire faction that will finally allow you to feel like a proper imperial nobility. From intrigues and art exhibitions, to hunting down deserters and protecting from the acts of terrorism, with this mod you can really make an Empire-centric playthrough and make a play for the Imperial throne.
                  
                     With new permits, structures, apparel, vassalage system, royal honors, Great Hierarchy and titles, this mod is a powerhouse for those wanting to roleplay as the Imperial family, but it will also work just as well for people who only want one or two nobles in their colony.
                        
                           For obvious reasons this mod requires Royalty DLC.

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Art module is something long overdue. Being an artist, I struggled to comprehend why the only type of sculptures we can make are small, large or grand artworks on a tiny pedestal. It made Artistic skill pretty much undesirable. Come on, how many times have you said to yourself “Oh crikey, that’s another pawn that can only do art”? 
            
               A lot of people requested this mod on my Patreon so it’s about time I deliver. With this mod, your colony can create simple pottery from neolithic times, allowing you to gain some silver on the side to kickstart your base into the medieval era. Several new pieces of sculptures are available by the likes of small, large and grand statues, wall reliefs, decorative pillars and plinths that act both as an artwork and a shelf.
                  
                     With industrial era your colony will be able to produce beautiful embroidered rugs to decorate those ugly floors! A new type of wall - wallpaper - is now also available, allowing you to put some colour onto your grim, broken walls. Spacer era features a new type of art called a hologram, emitting beautiful shade of blue light and using intellectual skill to determine the quality of it - however it does use up power!
                        
                           And if that isn’t enough, a new type of quest reward is available - Archotech sculptures, not only being extremely beautiful and desirable, but also imprinting stunning imagery in the minds of surrounding colonists!

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Farming module is a great way to boost the efficiency of your colonies when it comes to providing food on the table. With a plethora of new hydroponics - one for early game and one for late game, you can really witness the technological progression of your colony - and gain more enjoyment from the game itself.
            
               A very popular request on all suggestion threads on RimWorld Ludeon forums is draggable hydroponics - at this point I believe it’s my duty to deliver, hence all three kinds of hydroponics now have a draggable version! Make it any shape you want!
                  
                     New structures by the likes of animal feeder, a sprinkler and a scarecrow have been added, each with unique code to make them feel more authentic. The scarecrow will actually make animals flee, hence stopping them from devouring all your precious potatoes!

            Vanilla Genetics Expanded is an overhaul to a popular mod by Sarg Bjornson called Genetic Rim. The mechanics of the predecessor have been improved greatly to fit Vanilla Expanded playstyle, offering many new paths to explore in a mid to late game colony. You can now incubate unique hybrids using brand new genetic engineering system, utilising powerful boosters and genoframes to create animals stronger, smarter and quicker than anything you've ever seen. Stay vigilant though, as there is always a chance of an experiment failing, producing one of many new failure outcomes - such as cute and cuddly fleshlings, or powerful, ever-expanding fleshgrowth.
            	
               	Venture out into the unknown with a new abandoned lab quest, procure equipment needed to continue experiments, breed paragon creatures - a real pinacle of bio-engineering, and in the end give life to an Archocentipede through a brand new path to end the game.
                  	
                     	Vanilla Genetics Expanded introduces a Hybrid quality system, encouraging the player to create higher-quality hybrids which get improved stats across the board. Alternatively, focus on overwhelming the enemy with hordes of lower quality beasts. At the end of the day, it's all up to you.
                        	
                           	With Ideology DLC, two new memes will allow you to explore different avenues of the bio-engineering path. Will you be a wicked scientist? Or will you follow things by the book?

            We have all been there, with a colony of a hundred pawns where everyone looks somewhat the same. Starting colonists with no character to their looks. This mod is our attempt at fixing that.
            
               We have worked hard to create a hundred new hairstyles that fit vanilla RimWorld perfectly! From tribals to space refugees, every possible pawn receives a set of new, fitting styles that add much needed character and soul to them, and with so many new possibilities, it’s unlikely two of your pawns will look the same!
                  
                     And in case they do, one of our major features is a barber’s table - a workbench available to be built from the very start of the game, that allows you to change the hairstyle, colour and beard style of your pawns. Yes, you heard me right. We’re also adding 15 beards, which have a solid 20% chance to spawn on any male colonist! If, however, beards are not something you’re into, you can disable them in the mod settings!

            A lot of players perhaps are not too keen on Gauranlen trees in Ideology DLC being yet another 'magical', unexplainable tree in the hard sci-fi world of RimWorld. I was one of them. Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Anima Theme changes Gauranlen trees to be a special kind of anima tree - and everything surrounding it has also been made in Anima style.
            	
               This means that not only we are expanding the Anima content, but we are also trying to hide the fact that more than one 'magical' tree is enough for the RimWorld universe. Whilst this mod changes all the Gauranlen art, it also changes the names of things to be using Anima theme. Furthermore, old Gauranlen tree - now renamed to Ancient Anima Tree, can also be used for meditation purposes same way Anima trees can!
                  
                     For obvious reasons this mod requires Royalty DLC and Ideology DLC.

            Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Dryads is a mod expanding on the selection of gauranlen dryads in the Ideology DLC. Whilst the idea behind them fulfilling the majority of the roles in your colony is neat, the current selection of dryads feels lackluster - they don’t particularly have any powerful abilities worth mentioning.
            This mod changes that - from new dryad types that fill roles not explored before, to upgrades to existing dryads, the whole gauranlen dryad system can finally become a focus point of the colony.
               
                  Integration with the Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Anima Theme also means that these new dryads get a reskin that suits Anima style if you have this mod active.
                     This mod is meant to enhance Mr Samuel’s new Youtube series with some more dryad variety.

            Vanilla Ideology Expanded is a mini-series of mods aimed at expanding the content in ideology - be it memes, relics and symbols or icons alike.
            
               This mod introduces many new headgear types and one new outfit type for your ideological pawns. No longer you will be limited by the selected few new headwraps and burkas for your Role generation - your leaders will now be able to wear amazing new headgear such as Horse mask or fez, while moralists will adorn themselves in rags, similar to those of typical monks.
                  
                     On top of that, Vanilla Apparel Expanded apparel is also patched with this mod, allowing it to be desired by ideologies or specific roles! Of course it doesn’t mean it’s random or anything, on the contrary, you can now expect that your shooting specialists might require military apparel, while medical specialists will want to wear medical scrubs.

            Vanilla Books Expanded is a mod allowing your colonists to pass their knowledge and skill to others. By writing a book about a particular field of science or skill, pawns will transfer their insights and knowledge, and when read, such books will train others in the same skill. Book reading is a new type of joy, with pawns picking up the books best suited for them based on their passions and skill sets, expanding on them whilst getting joy buffs.
            	
               Books feature complex descriptions, letting you, the player, know what the book is about in a funny, quirky RimWorld style. Later technologies also allow you to write newspapers, providing joy but spoiling at a rapid rate. In addition to that, maps and blueprints can be found with traders - former unlocking quests, and latter unlocking technologies!
                  
                     Books take a long time to write - no one writes a book overnight, but they increase in quality and value the more skilled your colonist is in that particular field of study. With this mod you can build massive libraries and have pawns enjoy the books in their schedule. Take a minute to read the book descriptions as we have spent dozens of hours writing up different combinations of words to make the funniest descriptions possible!

            Vanilla Ideology Expanded is a mini-series of mods aimed at expanding the content in ideology - be it memes, relics and symbols or icons alike.
            	
               The goal of the Memes and Structures mod is to add unique memes, and… well, structures to your game. For some reason certain obvious choices like Shinto, Taoism and Eldritch were missing from the base DLC, and this mod is here to introduce them to the ideology creation.
                  With unique memes, players will be able to diversify their playthrough every time they play. This should increase longevity of the game and also make it way more unique and personalised.
                     
                        This mod adds 36 new memes, alongside many new structures, rituals, precepts, specialist roles, items, objects and mechanics. It should greatly expand what Ideology has to offer, and meshes nicely with the rest of the DLC. With Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Memes and Structures you will be able to create powerful psykers that simply love chocolate, a corporate scrap trading business, a fishing republic, a bunch of god-king radicals, mechanoid technocratic union and much, much more.

Furthermore, this mod unlocks all the apparel in the game from being unable to spawn as relics, which means your colonists might now find holy power armor helmets or sacred boots. This should greatly enhance ideologies generated by the game.

            The goal of this mod is to add a new mechanic to make ideologies a bit more of a gameplay affecting challenge, as well as introduce a new form of threat that needs to be countered by the player once the colony is big enough.
            
               Ideologies, while docile and strong in small societies, often tend to divide larger societies. The more people there is, the more ideologies differ. This mod introduces an Ideological Schism, which is an event in which a new ideology emerges in some percent of your colonists. In a way, the new ideology is very much similar to what the base ideology is, except for one or two different memes.
                  
                     This will result in a player having two unique ideologies in one colony, both struggling to become dominant. Once one of the two ideologies completely vanishes, a new schism can occur.

            Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded is a small mod created to showcase what the new Pipe network code is capable of in Vanilla Expanded framework. It adds a rather simple chain, unlocked with Nutrient Paste research project, allowing the player to store nutrient paste in advance without the need for convoluted nutrient paste dispensers and hoppers. Players will now pipe nutrient paste directly from paste grinders into large storage vats. This can be connected to special output valves which serve prisoners and colonists with a not-so-tasty disgusting-looking stew.
            
               The introduction of nutrient paste dripper will allow you to automatically feed bed-bound colonists or prisoners. Truly the stuff of nightmares.
                  
                     Nutrient paste pipes can now be connected to any structure requiring nutrients, such as the Growth Vat, and will automatically supply it with required fuel.
                        
                           We are not removing the current nutrient paste dispenser or changing how it works - well, maybe a little change, but other than that this mod serves as new content, not changes to existing content.

            Vanilla Outposts Expanded will allow you to form a caravan, travel in the world map and create a camp. There are various types of camps, and each of them requires specific conditions to be met before they are set up. Each of these camps ships resources to the player. You are able to build a new Outpost Drop off spot to designate where the resources should appear.
            	
               	This allows you, the player, to set up resource chains and get rid of useless colonists at the same time. Be careful though, as outposts can be attacked and you will be forced to defend them!
                  	
                     	In case of any questions or bugs, use Steam Workshop comment section.

            Vanilla Persona Weapons Expanded is a mod that makes persona weapons a little bit more spicy - but only visually so. It never felt right that such a unique weapon does not actually look that unique - you can meet dozens of imperial royals, and all their persona weapons will just look like copies of themselves. I mean, youâ€™d probably customize your own weapon to be a bit more unique if you had it, am I right? 
            	
               With this mod, players not only are guaranteed a persona weapon of their choice and design upon reaching a rank of a Baron/Baroness, but every persona weapon in the game will now have a unique look. There is over 50 thousand different combinations, so I really doubt you will see the same looking persona weapon twice.
                  
                     This mod requires Royalty DLC.

            Vanilla Plants Expanded is a core module in a plant-based in the new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team. After hours of designing, testing and  designing again, Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder are proud to present this content pack to help you with your RimWorld farming simulator. This mod features a variety of fruit plants and crops to spice up your fields, with each prop adding something different and unique, allowing you to use the power of farming differently based on your situation and needs.
            
               Adding a variety of crops, each with different mechanics and traits, but still kept within vanilla balancing, we are hoping to give you a chance to tailor your farming industry to your liking. These plants are not meant to replace vanilla plants - they are balanced in-line with those, meaning rice and potatoes will still be useful!
                  
                     Fruit trees are biome-locked to two unique new fruit trees per biome, however bear in mind they do not differ nutrition-wise from one another - which is partly the reason why we decided to biome lock them. We also didn’t want to flood your farming menus with 12 different fruit trees that yield pretty much the same, but reskinned, item. This has all been done with the ease of use in mind.
                        
                           A new ability to plow soil has also been introduced once you meet the designated research. Plowing soil boosts its fertility to that of Rich soil, however when the plant is harvested, tilled soil returns to its previous form and needs to be plowed again.
                              
                                 This mod has built in patches for Vanilla Cooking Expanded, adding new functionality, such as new condiment recipes!

            Vanilla Plants Expanded - More Plants is an add-on module for Vanilla Plants Expanded from the Vanilla Expanded team. This mod adds a variety of fruit plants and crops to spice up your fields even further, with each prop adding something different and unique, allowing you to use the power of farming differently based on your situation and needs.
            
               Two new unique types of growing zone have been added: sandy and aquatic growing zones. These add new crops each, that can only be grown on them. They ignore fertility, but their crops will take a long time to sow and harvest, basically exchanging colonist work for growing plants in a normally unused space.
                  
                     Finally, by researching vegetable milk production, you can turn rice, coconuts, almonds, oats (with VE Cooking) and Soybeans (with VE Sushi) into milk. This is inefficient, and useful if a recipe NEEDS base game milk. It is not a way to work around Fine meals needing meat or animal products.

            Vanilla Plants Expanded - Succulents is an optional module for Vanilla Plants Expanded adding a variety of decorative plants, ideal to make your bases, houses, workstations and hospitals much prettier without having to maintain the flowerbeds. Succulents might provide only half of the beauty that flowers normally do, but their lifespan is three times as long, meaning your colonists won’t be forever busy with replacing flowers every few days.
            
               Succulents are inspired by real life succulents I have around my house, but for the purpose of the gameplay they have been unified stat-wise and simplified.
                  
                     This mod has been made by me and my girlfriend so you better watch your words! No one dare declare their love to me this time.
                        
                           I hope you will enjoy the mod, don’t hesitate to let me know what you think!

            Vanilla Races Expanded is a brand new series of mods to enhance Biotech features, add to the storytelling and the world-building of RimWorld, and to introduce new, cool types ofxenohumans, complete with their own unique genes, behaviors, mechanics and items.
            
               This mod adds a new race called Phytokins, which are a unique and extremely rare xenotype that mixes the DNA of a plant with human DNA. Phytokins are capable of photosynthesis and reproduce via planting a saplingchild, and come in three varieties based on what DLCs you have enabled. With no other DLC, the only Phytokin variety present in the game will be the evil Poluxkin.
                  
                     Based on genetic data retrofitted from Gauranlen Inc.’s investment into dendrology following the Fall of Sorne, phytokins are plant-based humanoids with an emphasis on symmetry and symbiosis. Their ability to subsist only on sunlight and affinity with any and all plantlife make them especially suited to aiding newly established colonies or underperforming industrial farms.
                        
                           Based on research from the forest planet of Phytok that committed to extensive analysis on human-compatibility with psychic energy, phytokin xenogerms are typically exclusive to high-ranking, supporting roles in megacorporations and planetary governments. Their unique way of reproduction has resulted in many identical offspring, with each generation becoming successively more competent than their progenitor, further contributing to their extremely low numbers. Their affinity with plantlife, along with the side effect of extremely high and ever-increasing psychic sensitivity, mean that any phytokin xenohumans found on the Rim are always adapted to high-concept, dominant trees that are present on their residing planet.

               This mod adds a new race called Saurids, featuring xenohumans with lizard characteristics. A number of new genes will allow players to turn their pawns into cold-blooded scaly monstrosities, whilst a new Saurid faction will be added alongside the Outlander factions and will provide a steady supply of Saurids for the players that desire it.
                  
                     Genetically spliced with synthesized dinosaur genetic material for improved compatibility with arid environments, saurids are cold-blooded isolationists with harsh voices and extremely low metabolisms. Their sharp claws and hardened scales make them particularly suited to melee encounters.
                        
                           For workers looking for higher-wage jobs, saurid xenogerms are offered alongside employment packages to particularly arid and hot planets. As conditions are quite harsh, they experience an attitude shift to be less social and consume fewer calories which allows them to be more profitable. As they are not excluded from starting families, saurids can communicate with each other using pheromones and are oviparous to reduce medical complications caused by lack of proper social infrastructure.

            Vanilla Skills Expanded is a new mod that expands on the vanilla skills system by introducing expertise to the extremely broad skill categories that vanilla has. Only 1 expertise per pawn can be gained. Expertise can only be gained in skills with both a passion and more than 15 levels. In addition, other mods can add more to account for their own additions of tasks.
            
               Expertise will allow your pawns to truly excel in specific skills that fit their abilities and backstories. From planet-known roofers and architects to professional chefs and master duelists, this mod aims to add much more character to all the pawns.
                  
                     Expertise is a permanent choice, so be careful what you pick!
                        
                           This mod also introduces three new passion types - critical passion, natural passion and apathy!

            Vanilla Trading Expanded is our take on the trading system and RimWorld, meant to add some much needed randomization, planning and strategy to otherwise stale trading. Currently in RimWorld, all values are flat and never change - meaning there are certain things that sell, and certain things that don’t. This mod will change that making market value of things dynamic, and changing based on the supply and demand.
            This mod overhauls the trading system and adds many new features, such as the Bank, Planetary news network, fluctuating prices, squeezes and crashes, loans, contracts, stock market etc. Please note this is not meant to be a realistic representation of the economy - I am not an economist, and I also don't want it to be realistic. It's simplified and almost arcadey, because it's a video game, and we don't need a corrupt market in the game to remind us how bad it is outside of it.

            Have you ever thought about how base game traits become repetitive after a while? Are you tired of seeing pyromaniac or kind pawn over and over again? Are you perhaps considering pyromaniac to be an instant death sentence in your colony? If for any of these questions the answer was ‘aye’, then look no further.
            
               Vanilla Traits Expanded adds 55 new traits, some offering unique new game mechanics, some being quirky and enhancing the storytelling, and some being straight up stat upgrades. Traits’ commonality has been adjusted after weeks of testing, to make sure no powerful or annoying traits appear too often.
                  
                     Using our new mod options menu, you can now disable specific traits added by vanilla game or any of the mods you have. This doesn’t mean that the trait will be magically removed from the pawn, but it’s commonality will be reduced to 0, stopping it from ever appearing in the game again.
                        
                           I really hope you will enjoy the effect of our hard work! Let us know in the comments what you think works and what doesn’t!

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Coilguns is an addition to one of the most popular mods of Vanilla Expanded collection - Vanilla Weapons Expanded, however it can be played without it. This mod adds a selection of spacer-tech weapons, fully craftable upon researching mass drivers technology. Coilguns come with a unique gimmick - whilst their firing speed and aiming time are quite unforgiving, projectiles fires from these weapons pierce any target they hit - flesh or metal, as well as any obstacles. Each obstacle reduces damage dealt to the next unlucky object/creature, but effectively these weapons allow your colonists to score multi-kills with a single shot.
            
               Shots fired by these weapons cannot penetrate mountains or reinforced walls from Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Spacer.
                  
                     Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.

            What I think this game was missing from the usual combat encounters is a punch, a smell of freshly fired bolters, the heat of an autocannon barrel and the look of surprise on the enemy faces as 10 homing missiles decimate their ranks. Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Heavy is our response to that task: This mod adds incredibly heavy weapons that can only be equipped on a handful of pawns - be it power armored troopers, pawns with a Tough trait or soldiers wearing our new industrial tech exosuits.
            
               These weapons utilise the limited-use code, just like vanilla triple rocket launcher, except they can be fired more than once. After the weapon depletes, it breaks, which means you need to simply craft a new one. No ammo system, nothing like that!

            Adds 10 new work mods for mechanoids:
            
               Find and destroy - Mechanoids, regardless of their type, will look for enemies and try to destroy them.
                  
                     Work and recharge - Work autonomously according to mechanoid type. If the mechanoid cannot work or it has done all the work it shutdown.
                        
                           Escort and recharge - The mechanoid, regardless of its type, will accompany the overseer and, if necessary, go to charge.
                              
                                 Work, recharge and escort - The mechanoid will accompany the overseer if it does not have a job, and will also be charged if necessary.
                                    
                                       Wait enemy - The mechanoid will shutdown and wait for the enemy, and when it appears, it will wake up and head towards the target.
                                          
                                             Work and wait - Mechanoids, depending on the type, will work, and when an enemy appears, they will drop everything and go to destroy him. If they don't have a job, they'll just shutdown.
                                                
                                                   Ambush - The mechanoid shutdown and waits for the enemy to approach it, then attacks.
                                                      
                                                         Defend yourself - Mechanoid, regardless of type, will attack enemies that get too close.
                                                            
                                                               Escort if enemy - Mechanoids, regardless of type, will accompany the overseer, but only if there is an enemy on the map. When there is no enemy, mechanoids shutdown.
                                                                  
                                                                     Work if safe - Mechanoids will work, but only as long as there are no enemies on the map. In case of danger, they will try to get to the safe spot.

Must be another mental break. It uses chemfuel for...fuel...And it fires in bursts to prevent itself from melting the barrel off, which has been reinforced to handle the heat, which means the barrel won't need replacing.

            This is a renovated, overhauled fork of Giddy-Up, developed with permission from the original author Roolo. It's an all-in-one, containing all the modules in a single mod, internally modularized within the mod options. Giddy-Up allows pawns to ride animals around on the map, or even use them as battle mounts.

            Ever wanted to fly through Rimworld with style and practicality? Well helicopters are here to bring you just that, helicopters have always been the king when it comes to aeronautical utility, the ability for helicopters to land without a runway is incredibly useful, especially when secure spaces are of a premium due to pesky raiders trying to steal your tables, it also allows you to launch attack operations without needing an entire airfield to land on, which is great for retaliation and retaking your stolen tables.

                              This is safe to add to existing saves but if you want to remove the mod then remove all structures from this mod and save your game. Once you have done that the mod can be removed.
                                 
                                    This mod patches the offset for nearby graves so that these structures are included.

            Evacuate casualties out of contact faster with your pawns working as a team with this CASEVAC mod!
            
               CASEVAC allows rescuers to have up to 4 pawns help carry a casualty to the nearest hospital bed. This speeds up their movement with each added pawn, saving precious time to get the casualty further medical attention.
                  
                     The following mod adds:
                        - New rescue type called "CASEVAC"
                           - CASEVAC allows up to 4 pawns to help speed up the move speed of the rescuer for each added pawn
                              - Can only CASEVAC your own colonists
                                 - Can be prioritized in skill menu

When casualties are evacuated, soldiers are trained multiple methods of carrying the casualty to speed up their evacuation.

            Save precious time during the golden hour of survival with this first aid mod!
            
               "BCDs" also known as the Battlefield Casualty Drills are a series of emergency medical procedures for the basic soldier.
                  
                     First aid allows your pawns to tend to downed casualties on the spot. If medical resources or a hospital bed is available nearby, the medic will utilize these before hastily performing first aid.
                        
                           The following mod adds:
                              - New right click option on downed pawns to "Perform first aid"
                                 - First aid tends to downed pawns without a bed
                                    - First aid will allow the medic to grab the nearest medicine resource, otherwise they will tend to the casualty with no medicine
                                       - Can be used on enemy pawns and friendlies
                                          - First aid tending speed is faster than normal tending, however the quality of tending is reduced
                                             
                                                What is BCD?

                                                         What is First Aid?
                                                            Medical treatment given to a casualty or injured person until further medical help is available

                                                                     - First Aid tend speed is 200% faster (scaling is based on pawn's medical ability)
                                                                        - First Aid tend quality is -25% worse (scaling is based on pawn's medical ability)

            Save precious time and arrest a downed prisoner without the need of a room!
            
               "Arrest here" allows you to turn downed pawns into prisoners without having to quickly build a prison during raids or defense where a prison room isn't readily available.
                  
                     The following mod adds:
                        - Ability to arrest a downed pawn without prison room
                           
                              What is CPERS?
                                 Captured Persons or prisoners are types of protected persons covered by the law of armed conflict (LOAC). "CPERS" is the abbreviated short term for these individuals.
                                    
                                       What does "Arrest Here!" do?
                                          You can arrest a prisoner without the need of a prison room.
                                             
                                                What is the difference between this mod and "Imprisonment on the go!"?
                                                   - 3 second delay until arrest is performed successfully, rather than instantly
                                                      - zip tie sound effect played, rather than chains clinking
                                                         - Says "Arrest Here", rather than "Imprison (name of pawn)"
                                                            - Presentation and art style

                                                            - Rimdeed® prides itself with being compatible with Combat Extended.

You can also Trade In your colonists or prisoners that you would rather send to Rimdeed to be treated humanely instead of the dangerous and highly unethical slaver industry.

            A framework for processors to transform items and more, read player features!
            
               Main Feature
                  A processor takes a set of ingredients and turns it autonomously into a product over a period of time. The framework supports a huge variety of settings to individualize the processes and brings easy to use UI for players, as well as several other improvements, like better textures.
                     
                        Players benefits:
                           - New HD barrel texture

            RocketMan:
            
               NOTE: HugsLib is no longer required for RimWorld 1.4, 1.3.
                  
                     RocketMan is mod that is designed to improve RimWorld Performance.
                        
                           Important note: RocketMan should be the last mod in your mod list.
                              
                                 1- RocketMan doesn't support RimThreaded and never will.
                                    2- Bug reports with no logs will not get a response.
