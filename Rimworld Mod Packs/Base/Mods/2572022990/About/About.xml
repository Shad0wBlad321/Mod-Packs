    <description>A micro-mod which simply alters the tree draw layer so items/chunks/pawns are not drawn in front of it. This is a trade off between gameplay and graphical aesthetics, as some things may be harder to see in wooded areas. Note that this can cause especially tall modded buildings to look incorrect, like radio towers, so it may not work well for all users depending on your mod loadout.</description>
