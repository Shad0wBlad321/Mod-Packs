		This started out as a fork and merging of the Better Vents and Better Coolers mod, utilizing the Vanilla Expanded Framework instead, along with more compatible definition patching methods. It has evolved to include new features such as a wall heater, wall lights, and fencepost lamps.
		
		Credit goes to Skullywag for the original vent and cooler graphics.
