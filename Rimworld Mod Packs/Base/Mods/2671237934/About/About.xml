 Modifies quest rewards to focus heavily on items that cannot be crafted. This mod adds no new items.  Quests should consistently reward exotic items and neurotrainers, though this won't significantly alter the cash value of the rewards.  Rewards from the Imperial faction will be of higher quality.
 
 This is a manual retooling of loot tables, so will omit items from mods unless they are specifically added.  This requires little work but must be done for each item.  Feedback is appreciated.
