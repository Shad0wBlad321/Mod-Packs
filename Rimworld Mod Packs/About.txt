Names should be self explanatory but heres a short description of each just in case

Massive Pack is the largest pack i could make without downloading a ton more mods, it will be added to over time with mods i find cool/interesting

Vanilla Plus is the second largest and includes mostly vanilla expanded and other vanilla styled mods to not remove from the feel of the base game too much

Vanilla Improved is the smallest at just over a hundred mods and it adds almost nothing aside from quiality of life features
