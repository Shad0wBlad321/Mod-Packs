# RandomsGeneAssistant
While running my own 100% ethical gene farm, I found it difficult to keep track of which genes I had extracted and which ones were still needed. I created a small patch that changes the color of the background for a gene based on its extraction status.

• Red means the gene has not been extracted.

• Green means the gene has been extracted into its own genepack.

• Yellow means that the gene has been extracted, but shares its genepack with other genes.

I also added a button to the Gene Assembler that ejects redundant genepacks from the connected Gene Banks so you don't need to waste time searching through pages of genes.

This mod is safe to add or remove from any save.
So far in my testing I have not encountered any issues, but if any arise, just let me know.
