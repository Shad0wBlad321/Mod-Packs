            I'm sure you're tired of looking for mods that add new tracks, only for them to hardly fit among the vanilla ones. Even if they are great songs of their own right, you just can't play with that dissonance. I feel the same way, this is my attempt at rectifying that. I love Alistair's style, he did a wonderful job with the OST and it's a shame so many music mods diverge from his iconic sound so much.
            
               NOTE: For some reason the Music Manager bugs out when you skim to different points of a track added by this mod. Dunno why that's the case but keep that in mind if you're using it (it isn't required).

            This mod reduces the size of wind turbines to 4x2, allowing them to line up with solar panels.  It also reduces the area that needs to be kept clear to 4x4 behind and 8x4 in front, which  is the exact space needed for three solar panels.
              
               UPDATE: turbine blades have been shortened to fit within the four-tile width.
                  
                     
                        
                           Can this be added to an existing save?
                              
                                 Yes, your existing turbines will shrink.
                                    
                                       Can this be removed from an existing save?
                                          
                                             Yes, but either deconstruct your wind turbines first or leave enough room for them to grow back to their original size.

            (Quick Update to this mod until its updated on the workshop)
            
               Your grizzly bear is hauling a stack of neutroamine to your drug lab? Animal filth. Your megasloth is poking around the freezer for a snack? Animal filth. Donkey loose in the hospital? Animal filth.
                  
                     But... you don't care. Against all odds, you have a few colonists who are not incapable of cleaning. And it's not like you're going to lay down straw matting everywhere your hauling animals might step.
                        
                           This mod removes the warning. That's it.

            Modifies quest rewards to focus heavily on items that cannot be crafted. This mod adds no new items.  Quests should consistently reward exotic items and neurotrainers, though this won't significantly alter the cash value of the rewards.  Rewards from the Imperial faction will be of higher quality.
             
                This is a manual retooling of loot tables, so will omit items from mods unless they are specifically added.  This requires little work but must be done for each item.  Feedback is appreciated.

            When pathfinding costs are calculated, any terrain tiles that generate filth are taken into account and given some degree of avoidance. Also, roads can be given a bonus attraction, and the overall pathfinding range can be adjusted. Other features such as light attraction and extra range can also be enabled.

            Vanilla Expanded Framework incorporates a multitude of functionalities for different mods in order for us to boost performance by not duplicating code across several mods. Examples of shared functionality include custom base generation code with an amazing building export tool, customisable sieges, faction-based pack animal textures, faction based apparel colouring system, Orion’s Faction Discovery revamped and improved, Item processor code, shields, and many, many others.
            	
               	Orion's Faction Discovery?
                  
                     Yes!We have negotiated a deal with Orion and included his Faction Discovery mod within Vanilla Expanded Framework. Now, if you decide to add a faction to an existing playthrough, upon loading up the save you will have an option to spawn it's settlements and define how many of them you would like to spawn, as well as how far away from the player.

            A very simple patch that sets the wealth of all constructed floors to 1. The way floors impact colony wealth in vanilla always made little sense to me, especially since all pre-placed floors on the starting map automatically counted towards your wealth. Now those raiders won't send an army after you just because you dared to lay some good-looking parquet!

            Adds 32 landforms to the game, which generate biome-independently. The goal of this mod is to make map generation more interesting and varied, compared to the vanilla experience of simply having either a cliff or a coast on one edge of your map.

            Mechanoids don't have regular meatbag eyes, so why shouldn't they be able to see in the dark? And plus: work mechs don't sleep; so clearly they should be designed to work at any time of day. This mod removes the global work speed penalty from low light for mechanoids.

            Adds detailed melee combat animations, including duels, executions, and unique skills. Also (optionally) adds lassos to pull enemies into melee range.
            
                * Equip colonists with melee weapons (or melee sidearms) and they will be animated!
                   * Draft a melee colonist and you can right-click on targets to execute or lasso them.
                      * Place down a Duel Spot (under the Misc tab) to have your colonists engage in friendly duels.
                         * Craft Lassos at a tailor bench and equip them to pawns for an edge against gunfighters.

               Pairs best with other mods that increase requirements for steel and components, or for those who enjoy longer games and large base building.

            Persistent Precepts adds a simple toggle to the Ideology edit screen that prevents the re-randomization of Ideology precepts, rituals, buildings etc. when you change structure or memes.
            	
               	With this mod, you can ensure that your carefully crafted Ideology remains intact, even if you go back and change structure/memes. This also means your saved ideoligions can better act as templates when you load them in.
                  
                     	When the toggle is on, ideology re-randomization for the player is blocked for:
                        	* Precepts
                           	* Roles
                              	* Rituals
                                 	* Buildings
                                    	* Relics
                                       	* Weapons
                                          	* Venerated Animals
                                             	* Preferred Xenotypes
                                                	* Preferred Apparel
                                                   	* Appearance (Hair, Beards, Tattoos)
                                                      
                                                         
                                                            	Please note: The confirmation warning of re-randomizing precepts still comes up, please ignore it for now while I work out how to change the confirmation dialogue.
                                                               	If you start a new game and forget to turn the toggle off, your faction's ideology will be generated without any precepts/rituals etc. This is easily fixed by flicking the toggle back off and selecting "Randomize Precepts" button. Other factions generated at world creation and as part of events are not impacted.
                                                                  
                                                                     	Compatibility
                                                                        	The mod uses harmony to patch a few methods related to player actions on the ideology edit screen and precept randomization. It touches nothing else besides adding the checkbox so should be highly compatible with other mods.

            A micro-mod which simply alters the tree draw layer so items/chunks/pawns are not drawn in front of it. This is a trade off between gameplay and graphical aesthetics, as some things may be harder to see in wooded areas. Note that this can cause especially tall modded buildings to look incorrect, like radio towers, so it may not work well for all users depending on your mod loadout.

                                 Packaged survival meal and pemmicans as well as preserved food added by mods are no longer prioritized.
                                    If you use this mod, you don't have to change the food restrictions of the caravan participating members every time you send out the caravan.

Similarly, some roads require a certain percentage of the workforce to have a certain construction skill. If only a lower percentage is available, work will be reduced. If no colonist in the caravan has the required skill, work will be impossible. Prisoners don't work.

Roads cost more at higher elevation, starting from 1000m. Hills and swamps also have an effect, which can be checked when clicking on a site. When ISR2G is not used, the total cost can be further reduced from 100% down to 10% in the settings. Anything lower than 100% is probably quite unrealistic, but feel free to use the option.

            Your colonists can never be a true Rambo if they cannot gun while they are running. Therefore, this mod adds a mode that, when enabled, allows drafted colonists to shoot 
            while moving at the cost of an accuracy and movement penalty.These penalties can be modified in the mod settings of this mod. 
               Some things to take into account: 
                  - Fire at will should be enabled. Firing manually will cause the pawn to stop running. 
                     - RunAndGun mode can only be enabled when the pawn is drafted, and is carrying a ranged weapon in its hands. 
                        - The movement penalty is only applied at the moment the pawn is actually shooting or cooling down after shooting. So don't bother disabling RunAndGun every time you just want your pawn to walk somewhere. 
                           
                              &lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dependencies &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;
                                 
                                    This mod depends on Hugslib, so make sure that mod loads before this mod does.
                                       
                                          &lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compatibility &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;
                                             
                                                This mod should be compatible with existing saves, and removing the mod from saves shouldn't introduce problems. Moreover, this mod should be compatible with most other mods (including Combat Extended). However, keep in mind that this is hard to test for me by myself, and this is the first release.
                                                   Therefore some issues regarding mod compatibility are bound to come up. Most issues that come up should be easy to fix, so please report any problems.

               Pawns show their hands on their weapon when drafted. 
                  Should work with most weapons, vanilla and modded.
                     
                        Based on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2171708109]Clutter Weapon Hands[/url] but dynamically sets the hands based on the graphics of the weapon. It will however still use the old hand-definitions if they exist.
                           
                              There is also mod-settings where you can modify the settings for each weapon. These settings can be exported and included in a mod to add native support.
                                 All my "Continued"-mods should have native support.
                                    
                                       There is also support for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2543371889]Enable Oversized Weapons[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2038409475]Yayo's Combat 3[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513695736]Yayo's Combat 3 [Adopted][/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2575938407]Yayo's Animation[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1204108550]RunAndGun[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1628211313]Dual Wield[/url]. Hands will follow the weapons even during the extra animations.

            Version: 3.12.1
            
               A set of tools to make your life on the Rim a bit easier.
                  Easily forbid and unforbid items, select similar things, have things hauled urgently and affect the entire map with powerful new tool extensions.
                     
                        All tools are found in the Architect &gt; Orders menu. Right-click tools with the small mouse icon to access their special context actions.
                           
                              Pressing the Context Action key ("Equals" by default) will activate the first right-click menu action of the tool you are holding. 
                                 
                                    All tools are accessible from anywhere by pressing their shortcut key without opening the menu. See the Keyboard configuration panel in the options menu to customize the hotkeys.

               Let the river wash your trash away!
                  
                     This mod lets things float in water and move with the stream. In non-streaming water things will move about at random. Things can leave the map this way so can be used to dispose of things you dont want, corpses for example.
                        
                           There is a possibility that things spawn in the river that you can get use of, or even downed pawns you can choose to rescue. If [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761421485]Allow Tool[/url] is active you can set all spawning items to be hauled urgently automatically. 
                              
                                 There is also bars and nets that can be built in water. The bars can catch large objects like corpses, living pawns, weapons and apparel while the metal net can catch all items.
                                    
                                       Pawns may also loose their footing in moving water. They can also drown if being downed in water. Certain apparel will prevent this, such as the power-armor helmet. Any headgear with the EVA-tag from SOS2 will be considered a breathable helmet.
                                          
                                             If [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1542399915]SwimmingKit[/url] is loaded, pawns with higher swimspeed will float slower when downed. Also pawns with the Nimble trait will be half as likely to loose their footing.
                                                
                                                   Technically the mod looks at all items in water-tiles and calculates their floating value. This is based on what stuff is used to build the item, but some things like corpses have a default float value. Its also possible to add floatable-values to other things via patches, there is a patch for barrels of fecal-matter from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836308268]Dubs Bad Hygiene[/url] that can be used as an example. Higher floatable values makes things move quicker in the water.
                                                      
                                                         I made it mostly for my own playthrough but hopefully someone else can get joy from it!

            Adds refrigerated racks to keep food and other perishables cold.  Ideal for use in dining rooms, freeing up labour from feeding prisoners, or keeping food on hand for cooks.
            
               Updated this mod based on my limited understanding of C#, Rimworld, and Harmony. No guarantees are made about it's reliability or functionality.

            Deep Storage Units: yet another storage solution
            
               LWM presents a way to organize your supplies, loot, clothes, and even your garbage, to allow you a tidy base where your colonists aren't simply dumping stuff on the floor.  Deep Storage units include medicine cabinets, meat hooks, clothing racks, weapon lockers, etc, and all can store diverse items - just like regular shelves, but they allow more than one thing!
                  
                     ADDON MODS:
                         * Note: I have not used these, and have been super busy so haven't had a chance to add anything to the base mod. If you find right-clicking on storage slow, you might try this:
                            * A (faster?) UI for right-clicking on things: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169841018
                               * Little Storage 2, Vault, Simple Storage, etc - if you want more ways to store things, there are several available in the Steam workshop!
                                 
                                    FAQ / "I have a problem":
                                        * Meat Hooks require the Smithing research!
                                           * These Hampers are made of fabric, they don't hold fabric
                                              * Does it work with Vanilla shelves?
                                                 * You can always add more stored things in Mod Settings
                                                    ** (A little walkthrough for doing that: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2187075071)
                                                      
                                                         Want to say Thanks?
                                                             * Have ** in Art?  Draw me a picture of a little white mouse!  I'm reachable on the Ludeon forum.
                                                                * Have extra spending money?  Share a cup of something tasty (some places around here deliver!) at https://ko-fi.com/littlewhitemouse
                                                                  
                                                                     Notes:

                                                                            * Animals cannot by default haul to Storage - their little brains and paws (claws, etc) cannot manage the clasps, locks, catches, etc required to store things properly.(*)
                                                                               * All the units you can build are in the Storage menu - by default this includes other mods' storage buildings.(*)
                                                                                  * (*) - these can be changed in the Mod Settings (again, link above)

                                                                                              * You can also change what's allowed in the Mod Settings!
                                                                                                 * Plays well with mods that change stack size (OgreStack, Deep Stack, etc).  Want 10 stacks of 1000 Advanced Components in one square?  Go for it!  (Just watch out for mortar attacks...)
                                                                                                    * Plays well with mods that affect storage: Restricted Storage (LWM), Satisfied Storage, RimWorld Search Agency (not as well as Satisfied Storage), Stockpile for Disaster, heck - there's a Deep Refrigerator if you play with RimFridge
                                                                                                       * Plays well with mods that affect hauling: CommonSense, Pick Up and Haul.

               With a colonist selected, right click on the patient and choose "Dress &lt;name&gt;" from the drop-down menu, then select your choice of apparel from your stockpile. The selected pawn will fetch the apparel and dress the patient in it.

            RocketMan:
            
               NOTE: HugsLib is no longer required for RimWorld 1.4, 1.3.
                  
                     RocketMan is mod that is designed to improve RimWorld Performance.
                        
                           Important note: RocketMan should be the last mod in your mod list.
                              
                                 1- RocketMan doesn't support RimThreaded and never will.
                                    2- Bug reports with no logs will not get a response.
